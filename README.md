# Daily Checkins for Digital Collectibles: huh?
A system to provide actual functionality to existing digital collectibles: daily checkins!

For anyone wondering what to do with their cryptokitty (or ape) just lying around. Introducing the daily checkin system, designed to give additional value and functionality to all those digital jpgs out there. Designed to work with ANY ERC-721 or ERC-1155 compliant digital collectible!

## How does it work?
Any blockchain address is allowed to "check in" once a day, receiving rewards in the form of an ERC-20 game token: CHECKIN. The amount of CHECKIN that is minted and distributed is based on the value of the digital collectibles held in their wallet.

## Why would anybody do this?
Currently there's not much to do with digital collectibles, other than store them and hope they increase in value to be later resold. By adding an additional layer of daily checkins, it allows the ownership to remain but still provide "something to do" with them. The goal is to have additional games and services built on top of the CHECKIN token, which will provide more "things to do" with digital collectibles.

## Where's the rug?
We're going "satoshi style": no pre-mine, and the public function is the only way to mint tokens (source code will be publicly available). The system will initially be centralized until it is deemed able to "fly on its own", at which point ownership of the contracts will be directed to the null address.
